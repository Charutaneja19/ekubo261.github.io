			<h3>1)Positive news Section</h3>
In light of recent events,when we mostly hear negative news (like rise in cases) ,so we at 'The Positive Side' have decided to spread positive news. Being positive is the need of hour,so that we can work effectively.we completely acknowledge the fact that constantly getting across negative news can have an adverse effect on your mental health . Getting to know about what is happening around us is also extremely important and hence we can't just stop listening to news. A solution to this problem as suggested by the experts is to maintain  a ratio of 4:1 i.e for every 4 negative news you read , look for 1 positive news . This will help you to stay calm and to cope up with these testing times.That is why we have created a section for positive news which will help y'all to get going with these challenging situations.
we recognise that you must be stressed and might need an escape from your day to day activities. Itâ€™s no secret that letting your anger simmer or having rage outbursts hurts your personal and professional relationships.<br><br>
<h3>2) Contacts Section</h3><br>
We will provide contacts of verified psychologists and life coaches which can be contacted in case of people dealing with serious issues. The members of our site can access this feature and book an online session with our experts.<br><br>
<h3>3) QnA Section and Login/Register Section</h3><br>

In this section we provide a window where questions can be put by the user .
For asking a question the user needs to have an account registered with us.
So first it is mandatory for the user to make an account first,then the user will be allowed to ask questions.
The questions asked by one user can be seen as well as answered by another user.
If someone wants to answer a question ,he/she need to login first,then he /she will be able to answer the question.
