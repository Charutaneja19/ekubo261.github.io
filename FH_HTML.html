		<h1>The Positive Side</h1>
		<p>At times our heart and mind undergo a sudden rush in response to a stressful situation, have you experienced it? That is anxiety, a natural response by our body to a tacky or nerve-racking situation. <br><br>
		Are you feeling alone, have a rapid heartbeat, worrying about the unknown, and short of breath? Then you might be at the perfect place... we the people of positive side are ready to help.<br><br>
		In light of recent events, we recognise that you must be stressed and might need an escape from your day to day activities. Itâ€™s no secret that letting your anger simmer or having rage outbursts hurts your personal and professional relationships. 
		Constantly bottling up our frustration/emotions can lead to physical and emotional reactionsso how is that possible???    Meditation is a beautiful process in which one gets in touch with their inner selves and beyond.
		At Heartfulness Meditation, all the participants sit comfortably, close their eyes and place a gentle thought of a divine light in their hearts. In other words, just like we light lamps and candles, in this form of meditation, we light a lamp in our heart and focus on it. All distracting thoughts are treated as uninvited guests and are ignored.<br><br>			
		During this pandemic, we have seen and heard so much about the miserable situation that the world is in right now. Constant exposure to such depressing news has affected the mental health of many people. So we at 'The Positive Side' have taken an initiative to help bring the good news around the world...
